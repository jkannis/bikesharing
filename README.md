## Summary
- The bikesharing program in NYC is very successful and highly utilized. Based on this data, a bikesharing program should be pursued for Des Moines, Iowa.
### Additional Considerations
1. The population of Des Moines, Iowa is very different from the population of New York City so this may not be an accurate representation to base the new business upon.
2. Des Moines, Iowa does not have as many tourists and attractions as New York City so the new bikesharing program will likely need to be scaled down from the New York City program.
